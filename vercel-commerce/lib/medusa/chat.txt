can you see the terminal? 

check now?

sooo console still isnt loggin anything

its going to be the medusa console, restart the medusa app

if not then we'll try the other one again

hmm still nothing on the console as well as the frontend

reload the page on the frontend that brings up products with prices

http://localhost:3000/product/t-shirts

on my homepage i can see the price but not on the product page like individually but that is another issue to solve
most likely also missing the fields=+*variants.prices 

yes probably but the region thingy where do i look for that in the code? console isnt loggin a thing 

is it possible to log data on the browser itself?
